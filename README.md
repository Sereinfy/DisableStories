## Disable Telegram Stories
Yet another simple Xposed module, which disables Stories feature in Telegram official APP.

I don't want to build Telegram myself, or use 3rd party apps, or cancel Premium subscription (I hate ADs in channels), so I made this.

Tested with `LSPosed 1.8.6`, `Telegram 10.0.5`.

## How to use

1. Build (or grab the apk from [releases](https://github.com/xWTF/TelegramDisableStories/releases/)) & install the app
2. Turn on the module, select **Recommended** apps (Telegram)
3. Force stop the Telegrram APP
4. The Storries function is gone
